# Taping
## Legal aspects
Purpose of taping. Why? Can people reject it or not? What am I controlling with the camera?

If a camera only records a face, it can be, but only if students don't talk.

If a teacher asks if they can record the class, students might feel intimidated and accept. However, if a student does the same, then that won't happen.

Where will it be available? And to who? And how much time? What is it used for? Can someone do it?

The default is "no, but..."

## Educational aspects
Am I taping for you to study afterwards? Am I facilitating you to not come to classes?

What about jokes?

Will there be any post-editing? It takes time if you do it properly.

The default is "it's complicated".

# ChatGPT
Is it proper work or is it cheating?

## Purpose
Language improvements.

How do I make sure ChatGPT is OK? How safe is it to correct works from 2k students?

## Educational
Why should the teacher make the students use it? There is no reason for them to do it.

Students are trained to do things in a certain way. If the teacher pushes ChatGPT, students will think it'll be like that in the entire work life.
