## Objetivo
Our job is to figure out what are the problems to do what is in the video.

My name is Bill Gates and I'm pissed off with Elon Musk. I like this world.
He keeps saying things like going to Mars. I don't want to go to Mars. I want to fix Earth.

I can do this in a kilometer, but I need 700 million euros. 

## Problems
### Technology challenges
Cry.

### Laws and regulations
I need some changes in regulations. It's not legal.

### Scalability and cost
We still don't have the technology that allows to do this for more than one minute.

## Video scenes
- Broken code
- Hacking the car
- Car saving the guy regarding high-speed driving
- Car telling the police officer the guy has a girlfriend, because he was trying to [] her.

## Delivery
There are four scenes on the video. How are they different? Difficulty is different.

Do 3 pages for the whole video, or do three pages for each scene (12 total).

## Presentation
1-minute elevator pitch.
We will present to Bill Gates and we must convince him that we know what needs to be done.
We are the best and we know that because...

5 minutes of questions.
